##C++ implementation of Phone Book Management System
Phonebook is a simple mini project in C++ that can help you understand the basic concepts of functions and file handling. 
This application will teach you how to add, list, modify or edit, search and delete data to/from the file. 
Adding new records, listing them, modifying them and updating, search for contacts saved, and deleting the phonebook records are the basic functions which make up the main menu of this Phonebook application. 
We have used many functions in this mini project.
